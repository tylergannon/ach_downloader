== Hello, Square!

Here's a hack at your little programming challenge.  I decided to use a rails app because it was the quickest way to connect into ActiveRecord.  I'm not afraid of writing even complex SQL statements, but I only write SQL when necessary.

To perform the import, just run:

$ rake db:create ; rake db:migrate
$ rake download:fed_ach_dir
